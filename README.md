# Lightweight-CRM
# CLI CRM System (Learning Project)

## Overview
This project is a **command-line Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system** built in Python.  
It allows users to manage contacts and deals with persistent storage using a relational database.

This project was created for learning purposes as part of developing my core computer science skills 

---

## Why I Built This
I built this project to:
- Practice designing a multi-feature program rather than small isolated scripts
- Learn how to use SQL databases from Python
- Understand CRUD operations and data integrity
- Improve my ability to structure code ,handle errors, and refactor

I build this product not as a production ready system, but to learn the basics of SQL and system design

---

## Features
- Create, view, update, and delete contacts
- Create and manage deals linked to contacts
- Persistent storage using SQLite
- Input validation and basic error handling
- Menu-driven CLI interface

---

## Tools I used
To build this project i used multiple AI tools (copilot and ChatGPT 5) in order to correct syntax and identify errors.
I used Python, and I used the regular expressions library(re) for my input validation. I imported the library for SQLite3 to create/ manipulate a database using SQL.
I used basic Git commands in the terminal, as well as the GUI git options provided in VS code.

---

## How It Works
- Data is stored in an SQLite database
- The program interacts with the database using SQL queries
- User input is validated before database operations
- Logic is separated into functions to keep the code readable and maintainable

   git clone <repo-url
